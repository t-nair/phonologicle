# phonologicle
wordle but for the phonology of languages. all audio clips are from wikitongues.

# things to do
- gather audio clips [IN PROGRESS]
- create frontend: HTML/CSS/JS to deploy on GH pages, in future maybe swift/react native app
- create database of 300+ languages
- make puzzle bank UI AFTER launch
- "learn this language" button that takes users to a database of dedicated resources to learn the language
- could connect it to a general purpose website for accumulating links of great free/low-cost resources for learning languages
- add map svg with highlighted regions where we have languages from in the database

# more info
- each language has easy and hard audio clips
- for the languages that don't have enough documentation, the clip will be marked as easy/hard depending on the quality of the audio, background noise, etc.
- harder clips might have more background noise
- easier clips will likely have slower speakers/clearer audio

# current focus
gathering language audios from [this list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_South_Asia) (starting from the east)
