Wordle but for the phonology of languages 
# things to do
- gather audio clips: email wikitongues with prototype AFTER making it
- create frontend: decide which programming language to use
- create database of 300+ languages
- make puzzle bank UI AFTER launch
- "learn this language" button that takes users to a database of dedicated resources to learn the language
- could connect it to a general purpose website for accumulating links of great free/low-cost resources for learning languages
