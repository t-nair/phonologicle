# phonologicle
Wordle but for the phonology of languages 
# things to do
- gather audio clips
- create frontend: decide which programming language to use
- create database of 300+ languages
- make puzzle bank UI AFTER launch
- "learn this language" button that takes users to a database of dedicated resources to learn the language
- could connect it to a general purpose website for accumulating links of great free/low-cost resources for learning languages

# more info
- each language has easy and hard audio clips
- for the languages that don't have enough documentation, the clip will be marked as easy/hard depending on the quality of the audio, background noise, etc.
- harder clips might have more background noise
- easier clips will likely have slower speakers/clearer audio
